rdfdf - Functionality for rule-based `pandas.DataFrame` - `rdflib.Graph` conversion.

For representation of tabular data in RDF see Allemang, Hendler: Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist. 2011, 40ff.

> This project is in an early stage of development and should be used with caution.

## Requirements

* python >= 3.10

## Usage

For now rdfdf provides a `DFGraphConverter` class for rule-based `pandas.DataFrame` to `rdflib.Graph conversion`. 

Template-based conversion functionality might be available in the future.

### DFGraphConverter

Unlike [rdfpandas](https://github.com/cadmiumkitty/rdfpandas/) which requires URIRefs as column headers (and otherwise just creates invalid RDF with e.g. literals as predicates), rdfdf *computes* URIRefs (or Literals for triple objects) based on rules.

`DFGraphConverter` iterates over a dataframe and constructs RDF triples by constructing a generator of subgraphs ('field graphs') and then merging all subgraphs with an `rdflib.Graph` component.

Subgraphs are generated by

- for every row
  - for every rule in `column_rules`
    - looking up the `column_rules` key for the current row and calling the corresponding `column_rules` value.
	
`column_rules` values must be callables which are responsible for generating and returning a graph for merging. Note that rules actually don't need to return an instance of `rdflib.Graph` (e.g. if a rule just accesses `DFgraphConverter.store`; for an example of state sharing between rules see [below](https://github.com/lu-pl/rdfdf#more-involved-example)), in which case the result is skipped in the generator. 

`column_rules` values must be callables of arity 3; 
for every field for which a rule applies 
- the subject field value (specified in the `subject_column` parameter and possibly computed by `subject_rule` of `DFGraphConverter`), 
- the object field value (i.e. the current field value) and 
- `DFGraphConverter.store` (a class level attribute for state sharing between rules *and* `DFGraphConverter` instances)

get passed to the respective rule callable (see examples below).

#### Parameters:

- **dataframe**: A pandas.DataFrame to be converted.

- **subject_column**: Selects a table column by name to be regarded as the column of triple subjects.

- **subject_rule**: Optional; either a `Callable[[str], URIRef]` or an `rdflib.Namespace` which gets applied to every field of the subject_column; 
if supplied, `subject_field` in the `column_rules` will be what `subject_rule` computes it to be; otherwise `subject_field` will be just the raw field value of the current `subject_column` and must be handled manually in order to be become a valid triple subject (i.e. a URIRef).

- **column_rules**: A mapping of column names to callables responsible for creating subgraphs ('field graphs').

- **graph**: Optional; allows to set the internal rdflib.Graph component.

## Examples:

### Simple example
[todo]

### More involved example
For a more involved application of `rdfdf` (including extensive state sharing between rules) see the [CorTab](https://github.com/lu-pl/cortab) script.
