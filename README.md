# rdfdf

rdfdf - Functionality for rule-based `pandas.DataFrame` - `rdflib.Graph` conversion.

For representation of tabular data in RDF see Allemang, Hendler: Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist. 2011, 40ff.

> This project is in an early stage of development and should be used with caution.

## Requirements

* python >= 3.10

## Usage

For now rdfdf provides a `DFGraphConverter` class for rule-based `pandas.DataFrame` to `rdflib.Graph conversion`. 

A `GraphDFConverter` class for rule-based `rdflib.Graph` to `pandas.DataFrame` conversion will be implemented shortly.

### DFGraphConverter
[Substantial refactoring in progress]

### GraphDFConverter
[todo]
